I'm, I guess what you'd call a backend developer.

I self-identify as a Python developer, but I've written production code in
a lot of languages. Python is just the best :heart:

I've been writing production code since the turn of the century.
Which, I guess makes me a greybeard. Even though I only have
one in my moustache right now.

And I've seen (and been part of) waxing and waning trends.

Obviously not that kind of waxing...

Perhaps not as obvious, is that my beard is an intentional
part of this act...
You're welcome guys.
Also, the store was out of blue dye, so...

The more language you see, the less appetite you have for religious wars.

`DevError`: Only using tools written in languages that you like is not necessary.

Sometimes you can just be the user of a piece of software. Programmers make _the_ _worst_ users.

Don't judge a language by the first time you tried and didn't
like it.

PHP / Java / Perl / `your_favourite_whipping_language` implementations are running the Internet as we (I) speak.

Ok, 17 slides in, let's start this talk!

Cookiecutter is a CLI tool that lets you template your projects.

- project generation tool

- creates the files and directories setup just right to start a new project.

- Jinja templated so that you can customise the template.

- the CLI processes a template repo and prompts you for values to replace placeholder text

**1.1**

At 1000 stars, cookiecutter is medium sized.

`changes` (a tool I write to automate releasing python libraries) is, by comparison, an infant, at 50 stars. More about `changes` later.

It's sorta like a teenaged open source project (compared to the 10k stars luminaries like httpie, django and requests)

## Starting a new project should be as easy as

```

???
**1.2**

As a programming user, I create new projects.

I cringed everytime I `cp -R ../` from one of my example implementations

You want to be able to easily generate a new thing and feed improvements back into
the template.

As a member of the development team, I want there to be once place for me
to make improvements to the structure and conventions of our applications.
