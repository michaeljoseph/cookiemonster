# How I Became A Cookie Monster

## User to Complainer to Helper to Core: the evolution of open source software development communities

## Abstract
My journey from a user of the awesome [cookiecutter], to a core member of an awesome += 1 community.

I've learned a lot from the modest and multi-talented [@audreyr] about leading a community, writing clean cross-platform Python code and putting the B in [BFDL].

My talk aims to introduce [cookiecutter] to a wider audience (if you're at a PyCon and you create new projects, you **need** to use it) and to chart my progress from the outside to the inside of an open source project.
  
## Description
We start with a brief introduction to cookiecutter, why it's awesome and why you should use it.

Listen as I digress and ramble about:
- [The Unix Way]
- Onion Programming
- Doing One Thing Well
- Keeping Stupid And Simple
- Adding [One More Layer Of Abstraction]

> ((6a) (corollary). It is always possible to add another level of indirection)

- And The Power Of Constraints

Follow step-by-step as I synthesize and refactor and test and document a cookiecutter feature: [Extra Context!]

Endure as I posit that the ideal open source software development workflow is a battle tested, resilient, improbable and
inherently evolutionary process.

Applaud as I summarise.
